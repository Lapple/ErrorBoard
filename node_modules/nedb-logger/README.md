# NeDB Logger

NeDB Logger is a logger that writes object and JSON messages to a datafile readable by <a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb" target="_blank">NeDB</a>, with minimal RAM footprint since it doesn't keep a cache of the database in memory. Use it when your application doesn't need to use the database capabilities of NeDB, just the logging ones. You can then use NeDB to query and modify your database.


## API
```javascript
var Logger = require('nedb-logger')
  , logger = new Logger({ filename: "path/to/datafile" });

logger.insert({ hello: "world", number: 42, timestamp: new Date() }, function (err) {
  // err will not be null if the object is not well formatted for NeDB
  // meaning one of the keys contains a dot or begins with a dollar sign
});

// You can insert arrays of documents
// The callback is optional
logger.insert([{ planet: "earth" }, { planet: "Mars" }]);

```
