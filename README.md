# ErrorBoard.js

Track and fix JavaScript errors fired by your visitor's browsers.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and NPM
* MongoDB
* A free port

### Installation

    $ mkdir ErrorBoard
    $ git clone git://github.com/Lapple/ErrorBoard.git ErrorBoard
    $ cd ErrorBoard
    $ npm install -d

## Configuration

Main configuration file is `config/main.js`. Here are the example contents:

```js
// Please make sure you don't remove
// this wrapper
module.exports = {

  database: {
    name       : 'flatora_js'
  , collection : 'log'
  , host       : '127.0.0.1'
  , port       : 27017

    // Options for insert command
    // http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/server.html#Server
  , serverOptions: {}

    // Additional options for the collection
    // http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/db.html#Db
  , collectionOptions: {}
  }

  // App settings
, app: {
    host: '127.0.0.1'
  , port: 3000
  , output: [
      'console'  // Output to stdout
    , 'database' // Log to database
    ]
  }

  // The website that is being observed by the ErrorBoard
, observedSite: {
    title : 'Flatora'
  , url   : 'http://local.flatora.ru/'
  }
};
```

Edit `config/i18n.js` to add more languages. English and Russian are already bundled.

## Running

After you have everything installed and configured, run:

    $ node errorboard

Please note that the misconfiguration handling is not yet implemented.

Once the app has started successfully, navigate to the `http://app.host:app.port/stats/` (*e.g.* http://127.0.0.1:3000/stats) to get the error data. Similar error messages are not grouped, however the one can navigate to *Scripts* tab to get the idea which file:line pairs produce most errors.

## Browser snippet

The first time you ran http://127.0.0.1:3000/stats you probably won't see any errors since they were not being sent to the ErrorBoard. To start sending errors, make sure that the following JavaScript snippet is the first code, executed on your pages:

```js
// JavaScript
window.onerror = function( errorMsg, url, lineNumber ) {
  var e = encodeURIComponent;
  ( new Image() ).src = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/pusherror/?message=' + e( errorMsg ) +
                                                        '&url='     + e( url ) +
                                                        '&line='    + e( lineNumber );
};
```

```coffee
# or CoffeeScript
window.onerror = ( errorMsg, url, lineNumber ) ->
  e = encodeURIComponent
  ( new Image() ).src = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/pusherror/?message=#{ e errorMsg }&url=#{ e url }&line=#{ e lineNumber }"
```

Replace `127.0.0.1:3000` with the address and the port number your ErrorBoard is running (configured in `config/main.js`).

## Testing

Started writing some basic tests:

    $ make test
